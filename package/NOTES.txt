at the top level, we have a

registerable multiple proc inteface
===================================

so one thing is register and deregister a proc to get called.

it works like after.  you register a proc and you get back an ID.

you can pass the ID to deregister the proc or you can, also as with
after, cancel the proc by name.


underneath it, we have zero or more logboxes.

logboxes
========

logboxes are rule sets and actions to take when rules match.  The action
is usually to run Tcl code.  the results of the tcl code tell the thing
if it should go on or whatever.

it is easy to reload logboxes or add new rules to them, etc

definitely want to keep counts and have debugging enable-able.

probably use speedtables

it's sort of like a fancy COND from lisp
