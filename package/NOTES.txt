get a message

eval a bunch of registered procs against it

keep track of stuff and counts with speedtables


it's like a fancy COND from lisp


so basically

register one or more procs to be called from the syslog proc.

each of these gets called regardless of the return from any other.

this way it can do totally independent stuff and we run test stuff.

registerable multiple proc inteface
===================================

so one thing is register and deregister a proc to get called.

it works like after.  you register a proc and you get back an ID.

you can pass the ID to deregister the proc or you can, also as with
after, cancel the proc by name.
